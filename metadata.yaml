summary: >
  Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used
  as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis provides data structures
  such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries,
  bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in
  replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels
  of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and
  automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

  This charm supports Redis in Kubernetes environments, using k8s services
  for load balancing. This supports a simple Redis topology. Although multiple
  units are allowed, replication and clustering are not supported for the moment.
